When submitting dumps to Redump it is important to submit all **Ring
Codes** that you can see. Ring codes that are too difficult to read are
not required, but for the sake of completion, do your best. If you want
to get all the ring codes, a magnifying glass can help, also two
recommended products on
Amazon[1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JOO2EGK/)
[2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XNYXQHE/).

To clarify **we still want your disc submissions in redump, even if you
can't read all the ring codes**, just do your best :)

## General Ring Code Guide

Ring codes are the small letters and numbers near the center hole of
discs. They can contain important information, such as for identifying
software revisions. Always transcribe ring codes verbatim, keeping the
same UPPER or lower case in use as printed. Separate any
larger-than-single-space (" ") spacing breaks with "<tab>" for your
submissions.

### Types of Ring Codes

  - **Mastering Code (laser branded/etched)**: Mastering Codes are the
    most pronounced of all ring codes. They often wrap all the way
    around the disc ring and have spacing breaks in between.
  - **Mastering SID Code**: Mastering SID Codes are nearby the Mastering
    Codes. They are often smaller and sometimes hidden above the
    Mastering Code, barely legible due to size. They always start with
    "IFPI", then followed by four more characters.
  - **Toolstamp or Mastering Code (engraved/stamped)**: Usually referred
    to simply as "Toolstamp". These are impacted into the disc. They are
    often very short and stamped backwards.
  - **Mould SID Code**: Mould SID Codes are the most difficult to read.
    They often requiring looking at a certain angle, bouncing light off
    of them at the right angle, or using with a microscope. They are
    printed in the center-most area (the transparent area of the disc)
    and do not have color, simply being impacted onto the disc. They
    usually start with "IFPI", however additional text make be present.

### Example 1

This example makes use of a PlayStation 2 DVD-Rom.

The proper way to transcribe this is:

<span style="color:#ff0000">**1**</span>. Mastering Code (laser
branded/etched): Sony DADC<tab>A0100368905-0101<tab>15

<span style="color:#00dc24">**2**</span>. Mastering SID Code: IFPI L553

<span style="color:#f800e9">**3**</span>. Toolstamp or Mastering Code
(engraved/stamped): A2

<span style="color:#00baf0">**4**</span>. Mould SID Code: IFPI 94V1

## System-Specific Quirks

### PlayStation 1

PlayStation 1 discs are black, making full ring codes difficult to read
- except Mould SID Code which is easy to read due to it being impacted.

To get full ring codes, special techniques are required. They can be
found here [3](http://forum.redump.org/post/56095/#p56095).

### PlayStation 2

PlayStation 2 DVD-Roms contain Mastering Code (laser branded/etched),
Mastering SID Code, Toolstamp or Mastering Code (engraved/stamped), and
Mould SID Code on the Data side + Mould SID Code on the label side.

PlayStation 2 CD-Roms do not contain Mould SID Code on the Label side.
