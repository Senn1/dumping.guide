**Introduction**

Up until the mid '90s the primary method for CD protection was to use a
combination of disc-check verification and unique serial keys. However,
with the advent of consumer-grade CD-burners, the industry began to use
stricter forms of CD protection to minimize the effectiveness of 1:1
disc copying. SafeDisc and SecuROM were the most popular protection
forms of the era, but many other protection types were introduced (all
of which are explored in this guide).

**Tutorial**

The tools in the links above allow you to analyze and scan discs, files,
or sectors for known protection types. These tools can often identify
the version of the protection method as well. As a best-practice, it's
typically a good idea to check the disc with at least two of the three
tools to get an accurate reading. ProtectionID is generally accepted as
the most effective tool, but the other tools can occasionally identify a
protection that ProtectionID misses.

**Troubleshooting**

  - ProtectionID may need to be adjusted to run using Windows 95
    Compatibility Mode in some versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7.
  - SecuROM is generally best identified using "sector scanning". It can
    be confirmed using CDMage's 'Scan for Corruption' feature (which
    typically reports at least '1' medium error near the end of the
    image).
