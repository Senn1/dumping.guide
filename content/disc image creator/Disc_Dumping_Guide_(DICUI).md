      - DICUI disc-dumping app: download the latest available version
        .zip file
        [here](https://github.com/reignstumble/DICUI/releases/latest).

## Dumping

  - In the DICUI app folder, double click on **DICUI.exe** to launch the
    app.
  - **Disc Type**: Select the format / console of the disc you're
    dumping.
  - **System/Media Type**: Choose the system name for your disc, then
    disc format if the system supports multiple disc formats.
  - **Output Filename**: This gives a title to your output files, using
    the game title is a good idea (example **WipEout Pulse**).
  - **Output Directory**: This defaults to **ISO\\unknown\\**, changing
    this to the game title **ISO\\Game Name\\** will create a unique
    subfolder for you to keep your dumps organized. (NOTE: You cannot
    have punctuation in your directory name such as a period ".")
  - **Drive Letter**: This should automatically fill when a disc is in,
    but if you have multiple disc drives then select the one you wish to
    dump with.
  - **Drive Speed**: You can leave this default. (Pro mode: Select the
    drive speed you wish to dump with.)
  - **Start Dumping**: Click this and your dump will begin\! A
    command-line interface window will pop-up displaying the progress of
    your dump. When the command-line automatically closes, your dump is
    done\!
  - Note: "Scan for protection" option is just for checking if a PC disc
    has copy protection for when you don't want to dump the disc itself.
    The IBM PC dumping setting will automatically scan for protection
    during the dumping process. So ignore this "Scan for protection"
    button if you're dumping discs.

## Submitting Info to Redump.org database

Time to have your disc added to redump's database\! New dumpers need to
sign up on the forum
[here](http://forum.redump.org/topic/12228/want-to-register-please-read-first/),
then after account approval need to submit disc info
[here](http://forum.redump.org/forum/11/dumps/). After receiving
"Dumper" status, future submissions should go through [New Disc
form](http://redump.org/newdisc/).

About half of the information required will auto populate in the
**\!submissioninfo.txt** file which serves as a template for your
submission. The rest of the info will have to be filled in manually:

  - **Game title**: Most obvious, is located everywhere. Please include
    the subtitle if your game has one.
  - **Disc title**: Some games stored on multiple discs may have discs
    with titles. Examples: [Armored Core: Nexus (Disc 1)
    (Evolution)](http://redump.org/disc/15041/) and [(Disc 2)
    (Revolution)](http://redump.org/disc/15042/). If your game doesn't
    have multiple discs, ignore this.
  - **Game languages**: Start the game and look for "Language" menu in
    options. If you are unable to test, leave this empty.
  - **Version**: This will auto-populate on some systems, but for others
    leave this empty if you are unsure. For PC games, the version is
    sometimes printed on the disc or displayed on the in-game menu.
  - **Edition**: Some games were re-released in different packages, for
    example, "Platinum", "Greatest Hits", "PlayStation 2 the Best"
    series. If game was released in original package, post edition as
    "Original".
  - **Barcode**: Submit the numbers from under the barcode:
    [EAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Article_Number) /
    [UPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code) code,
    usually printed on the back cover of the packaging or disc case.
  - **Serial number**: Usually printed on disc itself. If an alternate
    serial number is printed on packaging, please note it.
  - **Ring code info**: Post whatever information is visible to you.
    Ring codes are numbers and letters primarily on the data side of the
    disc near the disc center/hole. Use the [Ring Code
    Guide](Ring_Code_Guide "wikilink").

Zip and upload all output files along with your submission EXCEPT the
game itself (all files except: .iso, .bin, .scm, .img). They can be
included as an attachment to forum submissions, or as a download link
(Google Drive, Dropbox, mega.nz, etc).
