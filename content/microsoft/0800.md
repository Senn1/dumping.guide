The **0800** series of optical disc drives are pulled from Xbox 360
consoles. Some models are compatible with Xbox 360 discs. What makes the
0800 dumping-compatible drives so special is that they're the only
drives that can dump Xbox 360 discs which have XGD3 copy protection.

## XGD3 Dumping-Compatible Models

  - Hitachi DL10N
  - Hitachi GDR-3120L 32, 36, 40, 46, 47, 58, 59, 78, 79
  - Phillips VAD6038 aka BenQ
    VAD6038[1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/141643694652)
  - Liteon DG-16D2S
  - Liteon DG-16D4S

## Choosing the Right Model of Xbox 360 and Removing its Drive

  - Drives pulled from phat 360's are generally going to be easier to
    deal with.
  - If you are going to removing the DVD drive from a phat Xbox 360 you
    already have, you can check the wire colors that are behind the
    faceplate for indication as to what DVD drive is inside: [guide
    here](https://www.maxconsole.com/threads/how-to-determine-which-drive-you-have-in-your-xbox-360.128/).
  - Ebay is a good source for working DVD drives pulled from Xbox 360's.
  - In (approximate) order of easiness to flash:
      - BenQ VAD6038 (This drive is flashable with no extra steps other
        than hooking up the power and sata cables)
      - Hitachi GDR-3120L Rom Versions: 32, 36, 40, 46, 47, 58, 59, 78,
        & 79\* (Requires cycling power on pin 3 to enter vendor mode.
        \*Rom version 79 requires the use of special CD as apart of the
        flash process)
      - Liteon DG-16D2S (These drives require the disassembly of the
        drive and use of a probe that is connected to ground. You must
        cycle power to the DVD drive and short a pin with your probe as
        apart of the flash process)
      - Hitachi DLN10N (This is a slim model DVD drive, requires a RGH
        console as apart of the process)
      - Liteon DG-16D4S (This is a slim model DVD drive, and can be a
        bit tricky depending on the firmware version. Custom PCBs,
        soldering, etc...)

<!-- end list -->

## Options for data connection from disk drive to PC

  - All in one USB option: [Xecuter X360USB PRO
    V2](https://team-xecuter.com/xecuter-x360usb-pro/) -
    [Buy](https://www.axiogame.com/?product=xecuter-x360-usb-pro-v2-for-xbox360)
    (Provides power and data connections, this will be the easiest to
    use)
  - Connecting Directly to PC Via SATA
      - Only a [handful of SATA
        chipsets](https://team-xecuter.com/forums/threads/52354-Known-compatible-sata-chipsets)
        are compatible for flashing the firmware. The [VIA
        VT6421](https://www.viatech.com/en/silicon/legacy/peripherals/sata-raid/vt6421a/)
        is a PCI expansion card and is the preferred option for flashing
        via this method.
        [Buy](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=via+vt6421&_sacat=0&_sop=15&LH_BIN=1)
      - After the drive has been flashed with a VT6421 and
        JungleFlasher, it should be plugged into the regular SATA ports
        on your motherboard.
  - UGreen USB to SATA Adapter + Sata
    extension[2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008635ATO) (required to fit
    inside UGreen adapter from ODD)

## Options for powering the disk drive

The Xbox 360 disc drive has a proprietary power connector. **You cannot
power it with plain molex or SATA\!** If you're using the Xecuter
X360USB PRO V2 then this section is unnecessary.

      - SATA power can be used if your power supply has the [5th orange
        or grey wire](https://i.imgur.com/0urnHeb.jpg) that supplies
        3.3v. A [SATA extension
        cable](https://www.ebay.com/itm/270737936679) should be used and
        spliced together with the original [xbox 360 power
        cable](https://www.ebay.com/itm/112805330563).

## Flashing the Firmware

  - The JungleFlasher app is used, download
    [here](https://archive.org/download/xbox-tools/JungleFlasherV0.1.96Beta_323.zip).
    Make sure to move the correct firmware for your DVD drive into the
    "firmware" folder before starting.
      - Jungle Flasher requires driver signature enforcement to be
        disabled, and the program must be run with admin rights. To
        disable driver signature enforcement on Windows 7, press F8
        while Windows is booting to reach the Advanced boot menu, and
        then select the option to disable it. Driver signature
        enforcement will reset to normal if you reboot. See here for
        [Windows 8
        & 10](https://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/)
