title: "PlayStation 2 Betas with Read Issues"
---

Some PlayStation 2 DVD-Rom betas will not read properly in some disc
drives. While it may be because they are scratched, sometimes these
discs actually just need to be read by the same drive they were burned
with (or similar drive model). Most PS2 DVD betas do NOT have this
issue, but some have been identified and data recovered perfectly from
this method. In this guide, we're going to determine which disc drive
you'll need to dump a troublesome PS2 DVD beta.

## Tools

  - [ImgBurn app](http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download)
  - Windows computer

## Determine the drive Manufacturer

  - Open Imgburn with the disc in the drive
  - Click on the "Discovery" icon, or select 'Discovery' from the Mode
    menu
  - Select the appropriate drive under 'Destination' where your disc is
    inserted
  - Information on the disc will automatically load in the right area of
    this window. (Note: It may take a couple minutes for the disc to
    load.)
  - Depending on your drive and the disc, manufacturer information could
    be in a few different sections, possibly under 'Disc Information,'
    'Pre-recorded Information,' or 'Recording Management Area
    Information,' etc.

Here's an example of what you might see:

  -   - Pre-recorded Information: Manufacturer ID: MCI4XG01
      - Recording Management Area Information: PIONEER CFDL041967WL
        DVD-RW DVR-106D
