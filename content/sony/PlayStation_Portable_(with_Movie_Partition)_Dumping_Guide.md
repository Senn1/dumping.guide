Movie partitions are region-locked and must be dumped with PSPs from the
region of the disc.

  - Sony PSP with the latest [CFW
    installed](https://revive.today/psp/cfw/).
  - Memory Stick with at least 2 GB of free space.

## Tools & Setup

  - [UMDKiller

    Copy the "UMDKiller" folder to: ms0:/PSP/GAME/

    Copy the "UMDKiller.prx" and "VSH.TXT" files to: ms0:/seplugins/

## Dumping

Note: UMD_DATA.BIN of each ISO has the partition number, 0001 & 0002.

  - In your PSP, navigate in the menu to Games \> Memory Stick and
    choose UMDKiller V1.2 to dump the first partition. It will be saved
    to ms0:/ISO/UCJB-98306.iso.
  - Connect your PSP to a PC and rename the dumped ISO as
    "UCJB-98306_0001.iso" and then move it onto the PC.
  - With your UMD in the PSP, use UMDKillerPRX V1.5 to dump the second
    partition by pressing the "â™ª" button. It will be saved to
    ms0:/ISO/UCJB-98306.iso.
  - Connect your PSP to a PC and rename the dumped ISO as
    "UCJB-98306_0002.iso" and then move it onto the PC.
  - Open Notepad and type the text below, make sure to modify the
    filenames to match your ISOs: **copy /b UCJB-98306_0001.iso +
    UCJB-98306_0002.iso UCJB-98306_merged.iso**
  - Save the file as Merge.bat and move it to the same location as the
    two ISO dumps.
  - Double-click the Merge.bat to merge the ISOs into one file,
    "UCJB-98306_merged.iso" is created.
  - Use clrmamepro's Dir2Dat function and uncheck everything except Add
    MD5+SHA1, create the .dat file to save the three ISO hashes.
