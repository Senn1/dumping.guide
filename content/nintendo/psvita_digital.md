## About PS Vita Digital Software from Playstation Network

After the Scene started discovering how Sony Playstation's servers worked and different solutions to access directly the storaged data were developed, a new milestone was reached when NoNpDrm solution was developed. As Playstion Portable and Playstation 3 had their own solutions for using Sony's encrypted software, NoNpDrm finally opened that door for Vita, allowing all data from Sony's servers to be functional. A project for datting, organizing and bringing access to the data for the users easily was developed: NoPayStation.

In the last years, No-Intro has been datting the same encrypted data that the community has been enabling access, on NoPayStation. As contributing this project helps contributing No-Intro and the other way around, we can point out NoPayStation Contributions FAQ as a guide for gaining access to the path (server link) where the data is storaged and get the proper files too.
