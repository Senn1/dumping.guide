## Dumping Tickets/Keys

[use the following, or you can probably just use *FTPiiU Everywhere* and use a PC tool to batch extract the keys from the tickets, if need be]

### Tools

-   [*tik2sd* by FIX94](https://github.com/FIX94/tik2sd/releases/tag/v1.1u2)
-   [*Homebrew*](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/)  (you only need access to Homebrew Launcher, temporary exploits can be used for that)

### Steps

1. Copy *tik2sd* to your SD.

2. Open *Homebrew Launcher* (via web browser or other methods)

3. Launch *tik2sd*, and press A.

4. It may appear frozen, but eventually a message that all tickets were dumped will display; you will return to the main menu.

5. Eject your SD, and copy the keys.txt from SD:/*tik2sd*/ - the keys in here are what you can share (tickets are console-unique for *eShop*)
