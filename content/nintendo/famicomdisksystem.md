# Famicom Disk System Dumping Guide
This guide is for dumping *Famicom* disks.

Note: *Famicom* disks are writeable, so unused disks are preferable when possible, but not required.

Additional, possibly useful info here.[?](https://web.archive.org/web/20181006182209/http://www.geocities.jp/gponys/fcdisk/fmcmdskw.html) 

## Tools

-   *Famicom* Console
-   [*FDSStick*](http://3dscapture.com/fdsstick/)
-   [Disk Read/Write cable](http://www.tototek.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1_35&products_id=206). Or you can build one of these yourself, detailed on the  [*FDSStick*](http://3dscapture.com/fdsstick/)  website.

## Guide

-   Hook the *FDSStick* up with a cable from your *FDS* disk drive and then the other end to your PC.
-   I do *BIN* and *RAW* dumps as well but I'm not sure how useful they are but might as well.
