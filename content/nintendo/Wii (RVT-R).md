This guide is for dumping Nintendo GC and Nintendo Wii dev discs. For
dumping retail discs, go here: [Nintendo GameCube / Wii Dumping
Guide](Nintendo_GameCube_/_Wii_Dumping_Guide "wikilink").

Dump using a computer. Note that this needs a special drive\!

## Dumping with a PC

**1. Installing and setting up software**

  - Make sure you have one of the following DVD Drives that are known to
    be supported
    [here](http://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-howto-dump-wii-or-gamecube-games-with-pc-no-wii-needed)
  - Download
    [Rawdump 2.1](http://filetrip.net/ajax.php?action=download&id=1609).
  - Download and install the latest version of
    [HashCalc](http://www.slavasoft.com/zip/hashcalc.zip). or any other
    program that you prefer for calculating CRC32, MD5 and SHA-1

**2. Dumping disc**

  - Insert the disc into the drive and launch Rawdump 2.1, and press
    "Start Dump". This will take some time. For Wii games, expect 2+
    hours, and for gamecube games, expect 30+ minutes. The file will
    save as a .wii or .wod file. Press the "Convert raw to .iso"
  - After the disc has been copied, launch HashCalc, check **MD5**,
    **SHA1** and **CRC32** rows, uncheck others. Select **File** option
    from the **Data format** list, then press button next to the
    **Data** field, select dumped image and press **Calculate**. The
    calculation process may take up to several minutes. These checksums
    should be posted along with other info.
  - Dump your disc again and compare old dump checksums with the new
    ones. If checksums are the same, your disc has been dumped properly.
