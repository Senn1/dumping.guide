title: "GD-Rom (SD Card method)"
---

Ideally you'll dump with the [GD-Rom Dumping
Guide](GD-Rom_Dumping_Guide "wikilink"), however some GD-Roms will NOT
work with that method and require dumping the HD area with an **SD
Card**. __NOTOC__

## Hardware Required

  - Dreamcast console
  - SD Card
  - SD Card / Dreamcast Adapter
    [1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/152801682889)
  - [SD Rip 1.1](https://hiddenpalace.org/File:Dcsdrip11.zip) (burn this
    to a CD-R with
    [DiscJuggler](https://legacy.padus.com/downloads/demo.php))

## Dumping Retail / Pressed GD-Roms

Dreamcast SD Rip is a program that can be used to dump Dreamcast games,
including GD-R prototypes.

1.  Connect the SD adapter.
2.  Boot the Dreamcast SD Rip disc.
3.  Swap in the disc you want to dump.
4.  Select **GD-ROM <bin> all track**.

## Dumping GD-Rs

  - Need a System Disc 2. This will unlock GD-R dumping.

## Submission

If the HD area has only one track, please submit along with a Plextor
dump of the LD area. If the HD area has more than one track, the tracks
will need to be properly split to conform to Redump standards (Fireball
knows hows to do this).
